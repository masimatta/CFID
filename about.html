            <p>
              We are also human beings and Need healthy life. Poor people lose
              their lives due to a lack of financial resources and the
              inaccessibility of health facilities in Pakistan. Particularly, in
              rural areas, poor people suffer from different diseases due to the
              nonexistence of health facilities. Tehsil Ahmed Pur East is
              situated in district Bahawalpur. People of Tehsil Ahmed Pur East
              are living below the poverty line. Health facilities are beyond
              the access of people, they even do not have access to meals and
              clean drinking water. More than 60 % of people are suffering from
              kidney diseases, hepatitis, and Guiney issues. Are they not
              citizens of Pakistan?
